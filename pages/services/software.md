### Language Experience
I have started to learn about software development and programming in late 2021 in order to start working on [CAMS](../projects/cams/). Prior to this, I had extensive experience with Scratch and minimal experience with Python.

Up to February 2024, I mainly used the Python programming language for server-side and client-side software projects because of its popularity and ease of use, allowing myself to complete projects faster. I have begun to use the Rust programming language for more types of projects since then. I can learn and use other programming languages when needed.

### Web Design
I have extensive experience in developing and maintaining web applications and websites. I can design and develop websites and web software of varying complexities by hand, with web frameworks or with web editors.

This entire website is designed, developed and maintained by myself.



#### Custom Solutions
These are web-related tools I have developed myself.

- StaticSite - Static site generator
- Lysine - Templating language
- Serine - CSS preprocessor


### Embedded Software
I have some experience in writing firmware for microcontroller-based devices and building custom embedded Linux images.

- C
  - Keypad controller for [MediaCow Touch "Nashville"](../projects/mct_1/) - ARMv6-M
  - Various projects using Arduino hardware - AVR8
- Rust 
  - Some experimentation with the Adafruit PyPortal - ARMv7E-M
  - MediaCow Touch 2 - x86-64, ARMv7-A, ARM926, 8051
- Python
  - Some experimentation with the Raspberry Pi Pico - ARMv6-M

### Other Software

#### Game Design
With programming for games, I so far just have experience in creating mods with the C# programming language for games using Unity.

#### Discord applications
I have experience in creating "bots" for the Discord messaging service in both Rust and Python.

So far, this has been just [SLAG](../projects/slag/).
