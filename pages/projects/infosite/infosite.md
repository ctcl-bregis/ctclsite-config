InfoSite is a dynamic website backend that is intended for simple, hierarchical websites. It is intended to be a replacement for 'ctclsite' that is used to run this website.

InfoSite's design takes some inspiration from werc and its fork, swerc with one of the main differences is that InfoSite serves dynamically generated content.
