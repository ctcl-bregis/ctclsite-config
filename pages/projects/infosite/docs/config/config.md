This page and its subpages are structured the same way as the configuration directory.

## config.txt
A file named config.txt must be present in the application root directory (wherever src/ and wsgi.py are present). 

The file should contain one line that is the relative path to the configuration directory. Only the first line of the file is read, following lines would be ignored.

In path names, the directory specified in config.txt would be referred to as "\<config path\>" hereinafter.
