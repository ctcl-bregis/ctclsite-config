MediaCow Touch Mini SP7021 "Floyds Knobs" is an upcoming circuit design project that may start after the conclusion of [MediaCow Touch 2](/projects/mct2/). 

## Hardware Introduction
MediaCow Touch Mini SP7021 makes use of the Sunplus Technology/Tibbo Technology SP7021 System in Package along with a Cologne Chip GateMate FPGA. If this project's development commences after MediaCow Touch 2, it would be the third project to use the SP7021 while the first to use an FPGA with the SP7021.

The GateMate FPGA is used as an external digital video CODEC as the SP7021 does not have hardware video acceleration.
