CAMS, currently known as 'CAMS Asset Management System' is an asset management software that I have planned to develop since 2021. 

It is based off from the custom inventory management software used by 2nd Life Inc. that I got to use first-hand during my employment there. It is unique in the way that it each asset; a single item, is assigned an unique ID.
