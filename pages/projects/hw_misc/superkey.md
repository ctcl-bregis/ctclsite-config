SuperKey was an idea for a keyboard that has a touchscreen display to the side. The idea appeared in November-December 2020 after the success with [MediaCow Touch](/projects/mct1/).

Initial ideas for the hardware were comedically overcomplicated: In the initial idea from 2020, there was the idea to use a Cologne Chip GateMate FPGA along with a Cypress/Infineon EZ-USB FX3 USB controller for just the keyboard controller then the system that drives the LCD would be a single board computer with a Rockchip RK3399.

I don't plan on bringing back this project any time soon.
