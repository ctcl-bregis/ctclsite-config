In July 2022, I had the idea of designing a mobile device that is a replica of a 'POW Card' from the 2017-2019 cartoon series 'OK KO Let's Be Heroes'. Initially, I considered using either an NXP i.MX6ULL or Ingenic X2000 SoC due to their low cost.

In January 2024, I considered working on the project again but using the Allwinner F1C200s SoC due to its tiny package size and low cost. Due to potential difficulties in the software stage, relating to the lack of video processor drivers which were only available as binary blobs, the project was shelved.  

Later in 2024, there was the idea of bringing back the project using a Raspberry Pi Compute Module SoM. I do not expect to work on this in the near future.
