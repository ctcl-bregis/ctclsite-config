NoteIO is one of the oldest mobile hardware projects I came up with. NoteIO was an idea to create a dedicated notetaking device that is completely offline. The device idea was effectively rendered obsolete with the use of [self-hosted wiki instances and file storage](/projects/svcs/) that can be accessed from anywhere. 

The original idea from early 2019 consisted of an Adafruit Grand Central microcontroller board, Adafruit RA8875 display controller, 7" resistive touchscreen LCD and battery control circuitry.

Later ideas in 2020 to 2022 were much more complex. For example, there was the idea of using an Texas Instruments Sitara AM62x-series SoC with ECC memory.
