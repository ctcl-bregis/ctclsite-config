In the future, I plan to build "Serdexmethylphenidate" which is a server to take place of the BladeSystem-based hardware. I do not expect to build this system until *at least* 2026. 

Specifications:
- Board: Supermicro H12DSi-NT6
- CPUs: 2x AMD EPYC 7343
- Memory: >256GB DDR4-3200
- Case: Supermicro CSE-825
