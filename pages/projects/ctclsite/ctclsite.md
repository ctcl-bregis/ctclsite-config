This page is the colophon for the website.

## About the Website Itself
This website serves mainly as my online portfolio and blog. 

### Content
Writing styling and the backend code myself allowed for more creative freedoms in the design of the website while giving the ability to add custom features.

### Hosting
Currently, as of June 10, 2024, the website is hosted by Orace Cloud using their 'Oracle Cloud Free Tier' which consists of a VPS with a single vCPU and 1GB of memory on an AMD EPYC 7551P. Up to May 2024, Vultr was used for US$6/month for a single vCPU 1GB on an AMD EPYC Zen 2 (7002 series). Before Vultr, I used DigitalOcean for US$7/month for the same specifications.

There are multiple reasons why I don't host the website on one of my servers such as [SVCS1 "Levoamphetamine"](../../projects/svcs/). For one, security: With the residential network setup that is provided, I do not expect the setup to be as secure as a datacenter installation; I'd rather not put my network and my parents' network at risk because of an invalid configuration or other vulnerability. Another reason, as mentioned before, I just have a residential internet setup with a dynamic IP that can change at any time without warning and it is possible that Verizon would not allow web hosting on residential networks. Using a VPS service is easier in many ways and data privacy is not a concern since the VPS just hosts this website and the data it collects, serves and stores is generally public information. There has been the idea for me to self-host this website but it is likely that would not happen any time soon.

## LiteFolio Backend Introduction
