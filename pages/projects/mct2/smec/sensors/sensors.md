## Temperature

### Inlet Temperature Sensor
The inlet temperature sensor measures the temperature of air entering the system cooling fan. It can be used to determine ambient temperature.

### SoC Temperatures
The temperatures of the CPU and GPU dies of the SoC are read from the integrated temperature sensors of the N100.

A thermocouple may be installed on the heatsink of the SoC to be read directly by SMEC.

## Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope
A combined 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit is used to provide the functions of a Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope. These functions are provided by a TDK InvenSense ICM-20948.

Possible uses of this device is to have automatic screen orientation, compass, free-fall detection, vibration detection and more.

## Barometric Pressure
A Bosch Sensortec BMP384 is used to measure ambient atmospheric pressure.
