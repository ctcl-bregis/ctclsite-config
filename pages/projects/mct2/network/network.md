Providing wireless connectivity through M.2 slots allows for wireless to be an optional feature. Another benefit is that wireless modules can be easily replaced for repairability and security purposes.

## Ethernet
MediaCow Touch 2 provides a single gigabit Ethernet port for wired networking.

Wired networking is provided by an Intel I210-series Ethernet Controller IC.
