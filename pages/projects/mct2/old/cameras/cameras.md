## Cameras
Like many tablets, MediaCow Touch 2 would include a front-facing camera and and a back-facing camera. 

The front-facing camera along with the microphone would be useful in cases such as video chat, video logs and selfie photography (though the device would likely require two hands to hold). 

### Back-Facing Camera
The back-facing camera would be in the form of a camera module with a MIPI CSI interface. I determined that the pinout on the LattePanda Mu is the same as the 22-pin camera connector found on some Raspberry Pi single-board computers. As result, I would most likely use a camera module intended for such model of Raspberry Pi.

### Front-Facing Camera
Like the back-facing camera, a MIPI CSI interface is used to connect the camera sensor to the system. 

Separate PDM MEMS microphone modules are used for recording audio.
