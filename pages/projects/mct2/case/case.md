## Material and Fabrication
MediaCow Touch 2's case is to be constructed from white PET(G) plastic as part of the theme.

Fortunately, the case's parts can be 3D printed whole as the total dimensions are within the 350x350mm bounds of a 3D printer available at a local makerspace.

## Design
The case is to be designed using OpenSCAD.

The case is split into three parts: the base, the display mount and the display cover. These parts are bolted together at four to six points.

### Display Mount
The display mount is a tray-like structure that holds the display in place.

The display mount was inspired by the System Cover Design Guidance section of the Innolux N156HGE datasheet and various laptops that use a similar design such as the ThinkPad X240.
