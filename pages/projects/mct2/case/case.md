Unlike MediaCow Touch "Nashville", MediaCow Touch 2 makes use of a 3D printed case. 

As part of the theme, the device makes use of white PET(G) plastic for the case. 

## Design
The case was designed entirely in OpenSCAD. Using OpenSCAD was significantly easier than using FreeCAD for this purpose due to my limited knowledge of the latter software.

The case is held together with bolts for easily assembly and disassembly.

Currently, to access modular components such as M.2 Key E, M.2 Key B, M.2 Key M and the LattePanda Mu, the entire display must be removed.
