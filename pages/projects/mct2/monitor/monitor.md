An optional part of the project is a separate device called MonitorCow. MonitorCow is basically an external monitor with the theme of MediaCow Touch 2. 

## Features
MonitorCow is intended to be easily to disassemble in order to swap parts such as the LCD panel. The internal connection for the LCD panel would be Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) which most modern laptops use.

### Connectivity
Like many external monitors, the main interface is a USB Type-C port with DisplayPort alternate mode.

A feature unique to MonitorCow is that it has a connector for HDMI for connecting devices that do not have DisplayPort over USB Type-C.
 
## Hardware
The hardware for MonitorCow is meant to be more simple to design and assemble, requiring no custom PCBs.

### Case
The case may be made from white PET(G) like MediaCow Touch 2. 

### PCB
Instead of having the complex task of designing another PCB for use in the monitor, an off-the-shelf controller board may be used.

### Display
The inital prototype may use the Innolux N156KME-GNA, the specific display was chosen due to its very close DPI value to the 11.6" display being used in MediaCow Touch 2 itself while having 2K resolution (2560x1440). An interesting feature is that the panel supports refresh rates up to 165Hz while having a 4-lane eDP1.3 connector.
