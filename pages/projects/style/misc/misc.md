## File header
Since 2022, I have been putting headers at the top of code files to describe the file.

The format of the header shall be:
```
// <project name> - CTCL <project start year> - <modification year>
// File: <file path realitive to repository root>
// Purpose: <short description of the file>
// Created: <file creation date, long form as described in time format>
// Modified: <file modification date, long form as described in time format>
```

For "project start year", see [Time Format Guidelines](/projects/style/misc/time/) for what is used as the starting year.

Example:
```
// ctclsite-rust - CTCL 2019-2024
// File: src/main.rs
// Purpose: Base webserver code
// Created: November 28, 2022
// Modified: October 6, 2024
```

## Names

### Software Names

#### Lua
I've seen Lua spelled as "LUA" like it is an acronym. It is not an acronym; it is the Portugese word for "moon".

When referring to the language, only the "L" shall be capitalized.

#### coreboot
As stated in the [coreboot documentation](https://doc.coreboot.org), coreboot shall be referred to as "coreboot" without any capital letters or spaces.

### Company Names

#### SK hynix vs SK Hynix
Technically both "SK Hynix" and "SK hynix" are correct spelling of the name however the latter shall be used.

#### Innolux vs InnoLux
Though the company refers to itself by both as seen in datasheets. The spelling "Innolux" shall be used.

#### ASUS
ASUS is to be spelled in all caps.

##### Zenfone
Zenfone should not be spelled with a capital "F".

#### Sunplus
Though common, the P in Sunplus shall not be capital. This also applies to the spin-offs SunplusIT (Sunplus Innovation Technology) and Generalplus.
