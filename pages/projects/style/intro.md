This document covers the how I style code, writing and other media. This document contains personal opinions on such.

Some inspiration for this document is taken from the style guides from [suckless](https://suckless.org/coding_style/) and [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

## Basic Philosophy

### Software
Software has never been a thing that I did for personal enjoyment; I develop software to fulfill a purpose. 

#### Resource Usage
Software should use the least amount of resources practical for the application.
