At the beginning of the 2020s, generative AI usage has taken off and many are making use of it.

## Policy
At first, I had the idea to only allow myself to use generative AI if it is to be hosted on my own hardware. Due to current hardware limitations, this may not be possible.

As of September 28, 2024, I rarely ever make use of generative AI.

### What AI is (not) used in

#### Creative Work
I **do not** use generative AI in the creation of creative work, especially for photography projects such as ['nonmonolithic'](../nonmono/). This also includes game level design, sound effect design and storywriting.

#### Programming
I may make use of generative AI to *assist* in development of software. Output of AI prompts will be reviewed extensively and modified to fit coding styles if the output can even be used.
