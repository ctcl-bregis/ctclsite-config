## Browser Support

### JavaScript
Web applications and websites should be able to function without client-side scripts when possible or when practical.

### Mobile Browsers
Websites and web applications should be "mobile-friendly" by default. 

Websites should adjust for mobile displays by using only the aspect ratio of the viewport/display. Website structure or content shall not be defined by the reported user agent. 

When adjusting for a mobile display, all functionality should remain.
