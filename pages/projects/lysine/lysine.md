Lysine is a preprocessor scripting language for webpages meant to replace SCSS in my projects.

Lysine itself is a fork of Tera and the syntax aims to be similar.

## Name
The name is based on the mechanism of action of the medication, lisdexamfetamine. An analogy would be lisdexamfetamine (lysine markup) is metabolized by red blood cells (compiled) into dextroamphetamine (CSS). The basis of the name is mostly inspired by my interest in ADHD treatments along with it being one of the most well known examples of lysine being used this way.

## Usage
Starting September 28, 2024, Lysine is now officially being used for the website where it is the first project I have used Lysine in.
