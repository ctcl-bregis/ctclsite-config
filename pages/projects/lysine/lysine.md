Lysine is a preprocessor scripting language for webpages meant to replace SCSS in my projects.

Lysine itself is currently a fork of Tera and the syntax aims to be similar.

## History
In July 2024, Lysine came up as a project for a preprocessor language for web styling. 

On November 30, 2024, the functionality of Lysine, namely the CSS preprocessor, split into the project Serine.

## Usage
Starting September 28, 2024, Lysine is now officially being used for the website where it is the first project I have used Lysine in.
