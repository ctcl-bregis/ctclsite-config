InfoWiki is a web-based wiki software.

## Background
Since 2021, I have been making use of MediaWiki for personal notetaking. It has been a reliable and effective tool for this purpose though the software is better suited for multi-user wikis. 

I have decided to make my own wiki software that is intended for single-user usage. 

## Features
NetWiki is designed for hierarchical page organization.

## Development
Python is used for backend code.
