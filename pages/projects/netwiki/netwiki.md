NetWiki, a temporary name, for a custom wiki software project. 

## Background
Since 2021, I have been making use of MediaWiki for personal notetaking. It has been a reliable and effective tool for this purpose though the software is better suited for multi-user wikis. 

I have decided to make my own wiki software that is intended for single-user usage. 

## Features
NetWiki is designed for hierarchical page organization.

## Development
NetWiki is to be written in Rust, using the Actix Web framework. 

Templating and styling is to be defined with [Lysine](/projects/lysine/).
