## Heavy Lifting
With my employment at 2nd Life Inc. and in personal experience, I have regularly done heavy lifting of often fragile and/or hazardous items.

On my own, I can lift objects up to 40lb (~18kg), this includes computer hardware such as printers, rack-mount servers and desktop systems.

I have experience with moving items with a pallet jack that up 600lb (272kg); two fully-loaded Cisco UCS 5108 blade server chassis.
