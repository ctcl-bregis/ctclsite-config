### MediaCow Touch 2
I know I have put MCT2 on hold for now but I had a recent revelation. I found out that some laptops have LCD panels with the touchscreen integrated into the panel itself and these panels are not difficult to get.

I have started to look into a screen swap for a father's laptop, specifically a ThinkPad T14 Gen 1. When I pulled the display out, I noticed that it had an Innolux N140HCR-GL2 display.

The display in particular is thinner and does not have a separate touchscreen overlay like the 11.6" DFRobot capacitive touchscreen that I currently have planned for use in the project. I would not be able to use this display as it is unfortunately broken, which is why I took it out of the laptop in the first place.

The N140HCR-GL2, however, is electrically incompatible with the eDP interface on the LattePanda Mu System on Module. If I were to use this display, I would have to make a separate but simple PCB design that would convert the pinout from the Mu to the pinout used by the display. I cannot use any interfaces exposed through the edge connector as the 'DDIB' interface is used for the external HDMI connector and the two 'TCP' ports with DisplayPort are used for USB Type-C DisplayPort Alternate Mode. If it is worth doing, especially now that I have the DFRobot display, is still unknown. Another thing to note is that the N140HCR-GL2, as stated in the part number, is fourteen inches so I would have to make the device noticeably larger in size.

### ContactList
On October 9, 2024, I started fresh on the source code for ContactList. This time, I immediately went for organization of code into modules. 

### vsc-black-theme
Recently, I decided to make some fundamental changes to the custom VSCode/VSCodium theme that I use.

The development of Lysine introduced me to how programming languages are parsed and processed which was helpful for understanding how color schemes are applied to code.

## Personal
On October 10, 2024, I briefly attended the "Brightpoint Connect" event where I showcased the desktop ["Polyethylene"](/projects/wbpc/pc_pe/).
