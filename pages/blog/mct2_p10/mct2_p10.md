## Overview
This entry would be quick. I have decided to halt development of MediaCow Touch 2, the related SP7021-Block single-board computer and any other hardware design projects for the time being as it has become too difficult to manage hardware projects along with college work and needed software project updates, such as this website. The situation was to the point where I could not get any meaningful amount of work done for college or personal projects.

### Future
I expected this to become a problem if I did not finish the project by August 26, 2024. 

I may continue development of MediaCow Touch 2 and related hardware projects once all of the other work I need to do is completed.
