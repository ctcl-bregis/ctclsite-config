## The Website
On October 21, 2024, I ran into the issue where I compiled the website backend on the desktop which I updated to Linux Mint 22 where it has a newer glibc version. When I uploaded the binary to the server, I got the glibc version error. I tried compiling on the server but was met with some errors relating to OpenSSL. I quickly started to write up a Python version of the website under the repository 'litefolio-py'.

On October 24, 2024, I looked over some StackOverflow, GitHub and rust-lang.org forum posts and found out how to compile the website for musl to statically link libraries. This was a success and I was able to compile on the Linux Mint 22 host and then run the website on the Ubuntu 22 server.

Being able to compile binaries that supposedly can run on any Linux system without having to use Docker or virtual machines is crucial for my continued use of the Rust programming language. As result, I will not rewrite the website backend in Python and continue to use the Rust backend that I have written already.

## Personal
I felt as I had yet another unproductive week.
