I made it through the fourth year of the 2020s, a decade where humanity has shown its worst, especially during this year.

In 2024, I yet again had a much smaller volume of completed projects than I wanted.

## Projects

### MediaCow Touch 2
In 2024, I made the first serious commitment to MediaCow Touch 2.

Personal issues along with the lack of planning and organization had me fail to meet the deadline for the project. However, what I have learned from the project

### MonitorCow
MonitorCow split off from MediaCow Touch 2 in August.

## Personal
Though challenging, I made great personal development this year.

I have made mistakes that I am not proud of, but I have learned from them.
