## Personal - New York
On Monday, November 25, I begun the annual trip to central New York.

This time, I have done something I have not done before: I brought a desktop computer with me along with two monitors. The PC was ["Polybutylene Terephthalate"](/projects/wbpc/#pc_pbt). In early 2023, I rebuilt the desktop into a smaller case. The idea behind using a smaller case was to improve portability for instances such as this where I would be away from home for extended period of time.





### Micron Technology
On Tuesday, November 26, me and my father went to Clay/Cicero, New York to check the progress of the Micron Technology plant that was announced in October 2022. This year, signage stating the location is of the future Micron Technology plant is present.

Part of me didn't believe that the plant was being built until I saw signage stating that specifically the location is of Micron.
