## Projects

## [CTCL Website (ctclsite)](../../projects/ctclsite/)
I have been updating the website regularly. Three code updates were made during the week: 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2 and 1.4.3. 1.4.0 brought great optimizations to the backend and reimplemented the "Link List" for a college club.

## [ToDoKiosk](../../projects/todokiosk/)
I rewrote ToDoKiosk in Rust using the Actix web framework in order to further gain experience with the Rust programming language. It was released on March 11, 2024 after starting the rewrite on March 10, 2024. An update, 0.2.0 was made on March 12.

## [CAMS](../../projects/cams/)
I have made the decision to use Rust for developing CAMS when the time comes.

## [SLAG](../../projects/slag/)
After finishing ToDoKiosk-rust, I have started to work on the Rust version of SLAG again.

## Personal
This week has been important for personal social development.

## GalaxyCon 2024
I went to the GalaxyCon convention in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday, March 16, 2024 with three others from the Brightpoint Gaming Club. 

I went as Alucard from Castlevania (anime) as I have historically chosen costume ideas that let me use my natural hair such as Finn from Adventure Time in 2022 to early 2023.

Ever since I started [nonmonolithic](../../projects/nonmono/). I have been taking "Backrooms-like" photos almost compulsively.
