### WBPC1
I have been using i3 for a week now. 

One issue that I have encountered is that audio is difficult to work with. Practically any time I want to play audio, I open Audacity and pavucontrol and change settings until it works. Sound being an infamous issue on Linux, I would likely ignore it.

### MonitorCow
As I mentioned in the Week 46-47, 2024 Blog post, I have decided to hold off from attempting to use the wood CNC machine to carve the case for MonitorCow until I get refreshed on using the machine.

It is likely that I would not be able to go to this class until sometime in January.

### Virus from Week 49
I do not believe what I had during Week 49 was the cold or the flu. Earlier this week, I have been experiencing the unique metallic taste that is often [associated with COVID-19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10859368/); what I experienced when I first had the virus in October 2022. This time, I have had greater difficulty with memory and concentration which I initially attributed to exhaustion and stress relating to college.

Both rapid tests I used returned negative however the tests expired in January this year.
