## Projects
As covered in [MediaCow Touch 2 - Part 10](/projects/mct2_p10/), on September 28, 2024, I have halted all development of hardware projects for the time being to work on college and critical software projects.

### Website
The website received, yet again, a major backend code rewrite. This time, the website no longer has hardcoded pages. Instead, everything is defined in a configuration directory. This would most likely prevent further rewrites. The process lasted from September 5, 2024 to September 24, 2024 which was longer than I wanted.

## Personal
Week 39 was, once again, a difficult period of time.

In central Virginia, the only weather effects from Hurricane Helene that I have seen is a lot of rain with light wind.
